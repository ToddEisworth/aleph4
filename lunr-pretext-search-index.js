We have defined to be those cardinals that appear as the bounding number for some proper ideal on . Using the density of exact sequences, we obtained an equivalent characterization in terms of true cofinalities. This can be re-formulated in terms of ultrafilters as well, yielding Shelah’s original definition: We make extensive of use of the fact that has a maximum value, which we denote .    What about those ideals and generator things?  In this part, we do a REALLY quick review of some of the work done earlier in the course.  Let be a progressive set of regular cardinals, and let be a proper ideal on .    We know that the structure has a bounding number , and that this bounding number is an infinite regular cardinal. By definition, is the largest cardinal  such that the reduced product is -directed.    There is a set in such that     , and    if and , then modulo .    Thus, he collection of for which the product has true cofinality is non-empty, and has a maximal (modulo ) member which we denote . This is one of the key uses of our assumption that , as we use the density of exact upper bounds to produce .

For now, we will use these sequences in the following way:    Lemma 5 . Suppose , and let .

Given a progressive set of regular cardinals , we will often speak about the -structure of , and by this we mean the collection of ideals , the sequences of generators for , and some choice of cofinality sequences for in .  Note that the ideals are unique and the generator is unique modulo the ideal . The sequence of ideals is also completely determined by the sequence of generators , as is just the ideal on generated by the family .  Note that by the density of exact upper bounds, we can assume that has an exact upper bound mod such that for all .

Clearly this is sufficient, as there are at most possibilities for the functions as on the right hand side.  We work by induction, similar to how we proved Theorem  , except this time we use Lemma  to fuel the argument. The idea is as follows: let , and choose such that . This means does what we want, except for a set of exceptions that is in , that is, If this set is non-empty, then we continue by applying Lemma  .  In more precise language, we will implement a construction that attempts to define sets , cardinals , and ordinals for each .  We begin by setting and . We let be the least ordinal such that   Given , if is non-empty then set and let be least such that Such an exists by way of Lemma  . Finally, define   Note that our construction guarantees that if is non-empty, then is strictly less than . Thus, there must be some least where is empty. This means that and so we are done. ◻   "

Our next stop is Shelah’s theorem that a theorem that gets at the heart of the connection between traditional cardinal arithmetic and pcf theory.  In this section, we modify our usual assumptions about and its associated pcf structure by demanding (this is innocuous as far as pcf theory is concerned), and we assume is a regular cardinal such that Our assumption on is so that such a exists.  For the remainder this section, we will let , and be as in the preceding section, for each .   Internally Approachable Models  Our main tool in this section and the next is internally approachable models, which we have seen already in class during our investigation of . Recall:    Definition 6 . We say that (an elementary submodel of some expansion of for some sufficiently large regular cardinal ) is -internally approachable if is the union of a sequence      is a continuous -sequence of elementary submodels of           and is an initial segment of .    We are going to want to assume that (together with its associated pcf structure) is an element of .    Characteristic functions of models  One of the reasons behind the usefulness of requiring is the observation that is not only an element of , but it is a subset of as well because we assume is an initial segment of . Furthermore, for any we know and so can be used to define a natural function in , the characteristic function of :    Definition 7 . The characteristic function of in is defined by   We will also need to consider the characteristic functions of models for . These functions are defined in the obvious way, and note that for each , the sequence is in the model because the characteristic functions are definable from their associated model.  The sequence is increasing and continuous, with supremum . Much of the work of this section will be to generalize Theorem  and show that there is a set of cardinality such that for any -internally approachable containing . Even though these models might be quite arbitrary, there are relatively few possibilities for their characteristic functions.    Building generators from cofinality sequences    Proposition 8 . Suppose , and let . If is an upper bound for mod , then     Proof. If this fails, then Since is less than , we can find a single such that and so But the model can see an such that In particular, there is such an , and putting ( ) and ( ) together tells us But this contradicts our assumption that bounds mod . ◻  This tells us that characteristic function is a least upper bound for modulo the ideal . But more is true – it is actually an exact upper bound.    Corollary 9 . Suppose and . Then is an exact upper bound for modulo the ideal , and is a flat point for the sequence modulo the ideal .    Proof. If is below modulo , then since there is a single such that bounds mod . But just as in the previous proof, can see an ordinal with so To see that is a flat point, we just note that for each , witnessed by the strictly increasing sequence . ◻  We close this subsection with some more corollaries of Proposition  .    Corollary 10 . Suppose . If and there is a such that then     Proof. Because of Proposition  , we need only show that the set in question is in . Notice that for all , so and this latter set is in by assumption. ◻  Finally, we have the following:    Corollary 11 . If and , then     Proof. If , then this follows immediate from Proposition  . If then has an upper bound modulo because is -directed. Now the previous corollary applies and we have the result. ◻    Minimal club continuity    Definition 12 . Let be a cofinality sequence for in , and let be a limit ordinal of uncountable cofinality. We say that the sequence is minimally club continuous at if for each , We say that is minimally club continuous at cofinality if the above holds for all of cofinality .  Let us check that this definition is reasonable. Given of cofinality and , the right-hand side of ( ) makes sense and so this equation defines a function in . If we let be a closed unbounded subset of for which the minimizing value is obtained, then for any closed unbounded , we have Since , we can let be the intersection of the sets for , and this gives us a single closed unbounded with the property that for any closed unbounded , In particular, for each we will have , and so by ( ) we know that for any closed unbounded subset of , In particulary, is an upper bound for modulo .  Returning to our usual context, suppose that is minimally club continuous at cofinality , and let be a -internally approachable model containing . What occurs at ?  The function will not be in , and neither is the minimizing club . We do know, however, that is a subset of and this means that is an element of for every . But then the range of will be a subset of (as ), so for each , and so But we have already shown that is an exact upper bound for modulo , so it must be the case that In the special case where is , we can assume , and we then have So reflecting back on our goal of trying to capture the characteristic functions of -internally approachable models, we have shown that if and is minimally club continuous at cofinality , then will agree with except perhaps on a set in . Our next move is to show that this set of exceptions, even though potentially not in , can still be covered by a set in .    Internal reflections  Taking stock of our story so far, we let and be as usual, and define We know is a generator for , but since it is defined using objects that are external to , we have no reason to believe that it will be in the model. In this subsection we will show that can be reflected inside the model , and the existence of such reflections will be used as fuel for arguments by induction on .  Given , let us define The set can be defined in the model , so each is in . We will show that for many choices of and , this set will also be a generator for that is a subset of , and this is how we produce our reflections of into .    Theorem 3 . Under our usual assumptions, suppose is in , while is minimally club continuous at cofinality  . Then there is a closed unbounded such that for each in the set is a generator for , and     Proof. Before getting in to the proof, let us recall that is our ambient generator for that is an element of , in contrast to , which is the generator we built by comparing with . Both of these will make an appearance in the argument.  Let be a closed unbounded subset of witnessing that is minimally club continuous at , so and this remains true for any closed unbounded subset of .  Next, since , we know for all sufficiently large that   Finally, given , there is an ordinal such that because is a cofinality sequence for .  We let be the closed unbounded subset of defined by putting into if     is large enough so that ( ) holds,     is closed under the function from ( ), and     , the closed unbounded set from ( ).    Note that is closed and unbounded in because the set is too, so we now show that has the other required properties.  Given in , suppose . By definition, this means But is in , so by ( ), and therefore But now is large enough so that by ( ), we are allowed to conclude and hence . Thus, .  To see that is a generator, we will need to use the fact that and . This means and so for -almost every , we have In other words, and we are done. ◻  This can be improved by using diagonal intersections to achieve a single closed unbounded that works for many simultaneously.    Corollary 13 . Suppose is such that each is minimally club continuous at cofinality  . There is a closed unbounded such that for any in and , the set is a generator for , and     Proof. For , we define This gives us a club subset of that works for each in . Now let be the diagonal intersection of the for . If in and , then and are in , and we have what we need. ◻  The strength of the preceding corollary is in the fact that for in , we have so that contains a sequence of generators for all that are each an internal reflection of the corresponding external generator .    Characterizing characteristic functions  We won’t need the full power of what we obtained in the previous subsection right now. What we actually use is the following: if , there is a set such that     is a generator for ,     is in , and     .    The model sees that the first two of these statements are true, but the third statement is something external that someone inside of will not be able to see. What makes the argument work is that if , then will be less than because is a generator, and will still be in because both and are. The exact definition of won’t matter: we can just let be consecutive members of where is least such that , and set     Theorem 4 . Suppose is a -internally approachable model containing , and is such that each is minimally club continuous at cofinality  . Then there are in with such that and     Proof. The proof consists of showing that can be covered by finitely many of our reflected generators, and we will do this through a recursion that must terminate after finitely many steps. We start by setting equal to , and . At stage , we will be handed a subset of that is in and cardinals for . We now ask the question If it is, then our construction terminates. If not, we define and   Notice that each is in because the generators for are available in , so our construction can continue if needed. If is defined, then so we cannot continue for infinitely many steps, and we must arrive eventually at a stage where the answer to ( ) is yes . At that point, we know Now for each , we know by properties of , and by ( ), so the result follows. ◻  We state the following corollary with our assumptions spelled out explicitly.    Corollary 14 . Suppose is a progressive set of regular cardinals with , and is a regular cardinal such that . Then there is a set of cardinality such that whenever is a -internally approachable model with , the characteristic function of is in .  This turns out to be a key ingredient in connecting pcf theory back to more traditional cardinal arithmetic. In particular, we want to show that in some situations, the characteristic function of determines much of the structure of .    The cofinality of  We will end this section with proving that the cofinality of the structure is .    Proposition 15 . Suppose and are -internally approachable models for some non-zero , and for all  Then     Proof. We show by induction on that . This is true for because , so assume for some , and let Since and are both -internally approachable, we know that and there is a closed unbounded such that If we define then is a subset of that is closed and unbounded in .  It suffices to prove that is subset of . Given we can fix an ordinal such that . This ordinal is in both and and of cardinality at most , so that there is a function in mapping onto . The ordinal is an element of , hence an element of by our induction hypothesis. But now and we are done. ◻  The above proof admits many generalizations, and we shall take a look at some of these later on. The important thing to remember is that models are tightly connected with their characteristic functions, and in some sense this is why pcf theory has things to say about cardinal arithmetic: we can interchange information between sets of ordinals and products of functions using elementary submodels and their characteristic functions. But for now, we will be content with the following theorem which was promised in the introduction of this section.    Theorem 5 . .     Proof. Let , let denote the cofinality of , and define We note that as well.  Any countable subset is covered by a set of the form for some -internally approachable model . There are at most possibilities for the characteristic function of in by Corollary  , and so there at most sets of the form ( ) by Proposition  . So let us define We know , and any countable subset of is covered by a set in .  To finish, note that if then the cofinality of is . So if is a cofinal subset of of cardinality , then is a cofinal subset of of cardinality at most , and .  For the other direction, assume is strictly less than , and let be a cofinal subset of of cardinality . Let be a scale in modulo , and for each let be the range of .  Now is cofinal in so for each there is an with . Since is a regular cardinal greater than , there must exist a single such that Now let us consider the function defined by Since is a cofinality sequence for  , we know for all sufficiently large . But this cannot be the case if is such that , and we have a contradiction. ◻    Corollary 16 . .   "

We have no way of knowing that is still a generator for  , as the smoothing process may have enlarged it too much. We need some way of guaranteeing that is still . This is where the work in the previous section will pay off, as we will be able to show that the smoothing process will work with the sort of generators we built there. To refresh our memory, we review the notational complexity concerning generators that has accumulated over this section and the preceding one.  First, in the model we have a fixed set of generators as well as corresponding cofinality sequences for each , which we assume to be minimally club continuous on cofinality .  For each in , the cofinality sequence produces a generator for defined as There is also a closed unbounded set with the property that for each , for all sufficiently large in , the set is a generator for , and   Our plan is to show that the smoothing of produces a transitive sequence of generators, and then show that these reflect nicely down into .    Existence of Transitive Generators    Theorem 8 . Suppose that is a set a regular cardinals with , and let be a -internally approachable model with for some regular satisfying . Then there is a transitive sequence of generators for . Furthermore, this sequence reflects into , in the sense that for each , there is a transitive sequence in such that , and .   The use of the dagger is because it looks like a t , so it helps to remember that these are transitive.    Proof. For each and , we will define functions for by induction. We start by setting . For the successor case, we define by     This formula deserves some explanation. What we are trying to do is to mirror the smoothing process for with the cofinality sequences we use to build those generators. Think now for a moment about what occurs if , , and . By definition, this means and But then On the other hand, since and are both minimally club continuous at cofinality , it will follow (and we shall soon show) that Thus, and we will be able to use arguments from the previous section to prove the set on the right is still a generator for .  Let’s do this formally. First, we denote the smoothing process as before:     , and     , and     .    We show by induction on that the following statements hold for all : and where denotes the closure of in the order-topology.  The first statement is true for by our choice of . For the second statement, we have what we need automatically if is in , as then will be a subset of . If but , then we know and by the minimal club continuity requirement for some closed unbounded . Since the range of is a subset of for , we have what we need. Now assume ( ) and ( ) hold for and all .  Since for all , we will need to show For such a , there is a with and by our induction hypothesis this means Thus, we have part of what we need:   Now look at ( ). Given , the value of is computed as the supremum of a certain set, so we need to check that each element of this set is in the closure of . This is true for by our induction hypothesis. If , then will be in the closure of by our induction hypothesis for , and so by our induction hypothesis for . Thus, ( ) will continue to hold.  From this, we conclude and combining this with ( ) gives us ( ).  We emphasize that the ( ) and ( ) are facts that are external to the model  . Outside of the model, we see that these statements are true, and that they hold only for those that are in . On the other hand, the actual construction of the functions is done for all and using the recipe ( ), and this is something that the model sees.  Thus, if for each and we define the resulting collection is in . We will use this to prove that for each .  This is an argument we used before when we showed that is a generator. It goes through under fairly general circumstances but we won’t belabor that now.  We need only consider the case where . In this situation, we can find a  in  that bounds modulo because the corresponding reduced product is -directed. Our construction guarantees that for we will have Since the function is in , we have and this last set is in by our choice of . Thus, , and is a transitive sequence of generators for .  We still have unfulfilled promises concerning the ability to reflect this sequence of generators into , and for this we need to use the closed unbounded set and generators from ( ). Given , since we can find in so large that for all , is a generator for that is a subset of . The entire collection is in . If we run the smoothing process on this collection, the corresponding sequence is also in , and since , we have Thus, is a transitive sequence of generators for that is in the model . ◻    The Localization Theorem  We know that a full collection of generators for possesses a nice compactness property: if then there is a finite collection of cardinals in such that   The situation is a little more delicate if we don’t have a full suite of generators at our disposal, and this state of affairs may arise in situations where we want to make arguments using transitive generators because Theorem  only provides transitive generators for which is not guaranteed to include everything. The following lemma tell us that the transitive generators we build for will suffice to cover a set , as long as we know is in .  The following argument should look familiar by this point:    Lemma 20 . Suppose is a subset of and . Then there is a finite collection of cardinals in such that     Proof. For each , let be an internal reflection of in , that is,     is a generator for ,     , and     .    Since , we know is in too, as well as Furthermore, if is non-empty, then is in , and . Now we iterate this process just as in previous arguments o produce in such that Since the primed generators are reflections of the transitive generators we started with, we have as required. ◻  We will use this to prove one of the important structural results about . We borrow the language below from topology.    Definition 21 . A set is left separated if   Left separated subsets of should be thought of as thin or rapidly growing . The next result shows us that these cannot be too large.    Theorem 9 . Let be a progressive set of regular cardinals. If is left separated, then .     Proof. By way of contradiction, assume that has a left separated subset of cardinality . We may assume without loss of generality that , and let denote and denote .  Let be a -internally approachable model containing , and let be the transitive sequence of generators for obtained from Theorem  .  Since , for each we know – in fact, is .  On the other hand, there is a such that   For each , we ask if for some . The answer to this may be either yes or no , but since , there is a so that if the answer is yes for , then there is such a .  (Think of this topologically – should be visualized as an open neighborhood of , with playing the role of a dense subset of . We are looking at those members of that are covered by the , and then it is clear that such a must exist. Since , there is a such that part of that is covered by some with must be covered by for some .)  (Let be the part of that is covered by for some . We now know two facts:     , and    there is a such that     We will get a contradiction by showing that . )  Now let . Since is in , we can apply Lemma  and find in such that   Since is left separated, we know and hence Now we claim Why does this hold? If   then is in for some . But must be in for some so by transitivity and we have ( ).  But now we have a contradiction, as on the one hand ( ) tells us and on the other hand  ◻  The next theorem is really just another translation of the bound we have on left-separated subspaces in . It says that satisfies a modified topological tightness condition.    Theorem 10 (Localization). Suppose is progressive set of regular cardinals, and is progressive. If then there exists a set such that and     Proof. Suppose with . We prove the result by induction on , so assume we have the result for all . It suffices to produce a subset of with and , as for each , our induction assumption will had us a set such that and . The union of the sets is a subset of of cardinality at most that picks up as a possible cofinality.  We can also make some simplifying assumptions by passing to suitable subsets of . For example, we may assume that , and has no last element. This can be arranged by first replacing by (to make sure that is the maximum possible cofinality), and then asking if has a maximum value. If so, we remove a generator for that value, and ask the question again. We cannot answer yes infinitely many times, as this would produce an infinite decreasing sequence of cardinals. But the union of the finitely many sets we remove by this process is in , so will still be the maximum possible cofinality of the remainder.  We will build our set through a construction that will attempt to pass through levels, adding some into at stage . We try to make sure that is in , and that This construction cannot continue for all stages, as it would generate a left-separated subset of of cardinality  . So this means we reach a stage where there is no suitable . We have arranged that does not have a maximum element, so the only way that we fail to find an appropriate is if But now we define and we are done. ◻   "
